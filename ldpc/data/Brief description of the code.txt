                 A Brief Description of the codes from professor Bane's lab
First, in the first line, the first parameter (m) is the number of variable nodes in the parity check matrix,
and the second (n) is the number of the check nodes in the parity check matrix.

Second, in the following m lines, the first parameter is the number of the check nodes connected to this variable node,
and the remainings are the positions of the check nodes.

Third, for the remaining lines, the first parameter is the number of the variable nodes connected to this check node,
and the remainings are the positions of the variable nodes.
